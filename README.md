## Description
A simple tic tac toe game to reinforce python concepts:
* Python classes, functions and methods
* Unit testing
* Documentation with doc strings

## User Story
* Players alternate placing x's and o's on the game board.
* The first player to get three x's or three o's in a row wins.
* Player x always goes first.
* In the event that no one has three in a row, we get a stalemate or a cat game.

## Installation
Install python 3.6 and run the program on the command line.
``$ python3.6 ticTacToe.py``
